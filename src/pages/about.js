        <p><strong>I am a recent computer science graduate and a full-time data analyst</strong> at Liberty University.</p>
        <p>I'm most interested in backend web systems and automation at the moment, but that's certainly subject to change in the future.  <strong>I enjoy learning anything related to CS</strong> — embedded systems, computer architecture, networking, security... even the history of computing.  The only thing I'm not in love with is CSS (<em>not that it really counts</em>).</p>

    <h1>About This Blog</h1>
    <p><strong>This blog serves as a repository for my projects and research into CS topics.</strong></p>
    <p>The scope of this blog is intentionally broad, as I plan to include a lot of variety in my posts.  Algorithms, programming, security — I'll write about it all.</p>
    <p>My hope is to post here at least once a month, but time will tell how realistic that goal is.  <strong>The intent is just to have a platform that motivates me to research, write, and share about the things I'm currently working on and thinking about.</strong>  Hopefully you find it interesting!</p>
